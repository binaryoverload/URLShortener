Two user types: user and admin
  Based of Azure AD groups? (UPN might be simpler...)


POST /api/url - Creates a url
GET /api/url - Gets a URL's information. If not the owner / admin, only the url is available (No other meta)

    URL information (Only * are available as non-owner/admin)

    If the URL is no longer active, the code can be reused elsewhere. If the url is not reactivated before the same code is used, the url will be permanently archived.

    Archived records throw a 404 for non-owner/admin
